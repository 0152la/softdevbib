This is the common softdev BibTeX repository. Rather than maintaining separate
BibTeX entries for papers, this enables us to have a single common file and use
prebib to translate it into something useful.

Entries should be of the format "<first author><2 digit year><first word of
title>". In those cases where <first word of title> makes little sense, use your
common sense to find something sensible and short.

Please make sure entries in here are of the highest quality. If you need to
indulge in any paper-specific mangling (e.g. because you are running out of
space), please do that on a copy of this file.
